Pour in half the egg and 75ml ice-cold water. Use your hands to work the mixture into a rough dough, then knead for a minute or so to bring it together. Cover and chill until needed. Will keep chilled for up to a day. STEP 2For the filling, bring a pan of salted water to the boil, then add the eggs and cook for 7 mins 30 seconds. Lift out using a slotted spoon into a bowl of iced water. Once cool, peel the eggs, then trim away some white from the sides (so that every slice of pie gets a bit of yolk), then set aside. Tip the sausagemeat into a bowl with the bacon, thyme, pickled onions and garlic, then squash everything together with your hands and season. Will keep chilled for up to a day. STEP 3To assemble, heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 with a sturdy baking tray inside. Roll two-thirds of the pastry out to the thickness of a £1 coin on a lightly floured surface and use it to line the base of a 20cm round loose-bottom or springform tin, tucking the pastry into the corners and leaving an overhang. Sprinkle half the stuffing mix over the base, then pack in a third of the sausage mixture. Arrange the eggs in a circle on top with the cut sides touching. Pack over the rest of the sausage mix, filling in any gaps, and scatter over the remaining stuffing. STEP 4Brush the edges of the pastry with some of the remaining egg. Roll out the last third of pastry to fit the top of the pie. Drape it over, press the edges together, trim away the excess and crimp with your fingertips. Poke a hole in the middle of the pie, score with the back of a knife and use the excess pastry to make pastry leaves for decoration. Brush the top all over with a little more of the egg, then bake for 50 mins or until a digital cooking thermometer reads over 70C when inserted into the middle. Brush all over with the last of the beaten egg and bake for another 10-15 mins until deep golden. Leave to cool completely in the tin. Serve with salad and piccalilli, if you like.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",1 hr and 15 mins

Mix well, ensuring each thigh is well coated. Cover and chill for at least 3 hrs, or up to 48 hrs if you have time. STEP 2A few hours before you want to eat, make the pitta. In a bowl, mix the flour, yeast, sugar and 1/ 2 tsp salt with your fingertips. Add 150ml lukewarm water and 2 tsp olive oil, and combine to a dough. Tip onto a work surface and knead for 8-10 mins (or use a tabletop mixer for 5 mins). Clean, then lightly oil your bowl, return the dough and cover loosely with cling film. Leave to rise for 1 hr or until nearly doubled in size. STEP 3Divide the dough into four equal pieces. Roll out to circles, as thin as you can. Cover with sheets of oiled cling film and leave to rise for 15-20 mins. STEP 4To make the tzatziki, halve the cucumber lengthways and scoop out the seeds. Finely chop, then combine with the remaining ingredients, along with a pinch of salt. Chill until ready to serve. STEP 5Heat the grill to its highest setting. Line a roasting tin with foil and find 4 metal skewers long enough to sit across the top with a little space underneath. Remove the chicken from the fridge, take one thigh and thread it over 2 skewers, so it has a skewer through either side. Thread another piece of chicken on top, leaving a slight gap between each piece; you should fit 6 thighs on each pair of skewers. Position the skewers on top of the roasting tin and set aside while you finish the pittas. STEP 6Heat a large frying pan (or two if you have them) over a medium-high heat and brush the breads with oil. Gently lift one into the pan. It should sizzle, and bubbles should appear on the surface after 1-2 mins. When the underside is golden, flip it and cook for another 2-3 mins. Continue until all the breads are cooked, wrapping them in foil as you go. Keep the bread warm in the bottom of the oven while you cook the chicken. Alternatively, cook on the barbecue for 5-8 mins, turning occasionally. STEP 7Put the chicken under the hot grill and cook for 15-20 mins, brushing with oil and any juices from the bottom of the tin regularly, and turning halfway through cooking. Once cooked, remove from the oven and rest for 5 mins. STEP 8Cut through each pair of skewers to make four kebabs and serve in the warm bread, with lettuce, tomato, red onion, lemon wedges and tzatziki.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",45 mins

STEP 2Reduce oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line a 20cm x 30cm baking tin with a long double thickness strip of parchment (this will help you to lift out the pie once cooked). Squeeze the two blocks of pastry together, then roll out on a floured surface – the pastry should be about the thickness of a £1 coin. Use the pastry to line the tin, leaving any excess pastry hanging over the edges. STEP 3Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the base of the pastry. Layer in the beetroot slices, peppers, squash, onions, feta, potatoes, peas and herbs (in that order for a nice rainbow effect), seasoning well between each layer. Beat the eggs and pour slowly over the filling until most of it has sunk through the layers, saving a little to glaze the top. Brush some egg over the overhanging pastry then lay the rolled pastry sheet on top. Press the pastry sheets together, then use some kitchen scissors to trim the excess pastry, leaving about 2cm. Roll the edges in to seal, then press them firmly with a fork. Brush with egg, sprinkle with seeds, then use the fork prongs to mark out 12 portions.

Gazpacho with runner bean tempura & pickled coriander seeds,"25ml white wine vinegar, 1 tsp sherry vinegar, 1 tbsp caster sugar, 2 tsp coriander seeds, 1kg tomatoes, 200g cucumber, peeled and deseeded, 2 tsp capers, 2 garlic cloves, 1 red chilli, deseeded, 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, 1-2 tbsp sherry vinegar, 150ml vegetable oil, 100g runner beans, stringed, cut in half, then sliced lengthways (discarding tough beans from inside), 90g plain flour, ½ tsp cumin seeds, ½ egg, beaten, 200ml ice-cold sparkling water","STEP 1To make the pickled coriander seeds, put the vinegars in a small pan with the sugar and 25ml water. Bring to the boil, drop in the coriander seeds, turn off the heat and leave to infuse. STEP 2To peel the tomatoes, lightly score a cross in the top of each one, place in a large bowl and cover with boiling water for 1 min. Drain and peel. Cut each one into quarters and use a knife to scrape away the seeds. Don’t discard what you remove – sieve out the seeds and use the juice in the next step. STEP 3Blitz the tomatoes, cucumber, capers, garlic, chilli and 2 tsp sea salt in a food processor. Pour into a bowl and chill for a couple of hours for the flavours to meld, then add the olive oil and stir. Add 1 tbsp of the sherry vinegar and taste. If it needs more to bring out the flavours, then add another tbsp. Divide between bowls and chill the soup while you make the runner bean tempura. STEP 4Pour the vegetable oil into a high-sided saucepan and set over a medium heat to get up to temperature (about 180C) while you make the batter. STEP 5To make the batter, put the flour, a pinch of salt and the cumin seeds in a bowl and stir. Add the beaten egg, then pour in the water. Gently stir the mixture, taking care not to over-mix it – a few lumps help give tempura its texture. Test the temperature of the oil by dropping in a little bit of batter. It should bubble and float to the top. If it browns immediately, reduce the heat. STEP 6Mix the runner beans into the batter and then fry in batches, removing with a slotted spoon once they’re crisp, golden and just starting to brown. Drain on kitchen paper and season. Top each bowl of soup with some crispy runner beans, and spoon over a little of the drained, pickled coriander seeds.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",30 mins

Once bubbling and the beans are hot, season to taste and serve.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",30 mins

Tear 1 medium ciabatta into big, ragged croutons or, if you prefer, cut with a bread knife. Spread over a large baking sheet or tray and sprinkle over 2 tbsp olive oil. STEP 2Rub the oil into the bread and season with a little salt if you like (sea salt crystals are best for this). Bake for 8-10 mins, turning the croutons a few times during cooking so they brown evenly. STEP 3Rub 2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts with 1 tbsp olive oil, season. Place pan over a medium heat for 1 min, until hot, but not smoking. Lay the chicken on the pan (it will sizzle if it’s hot enough) and leave for 4 mins. STEP 4Turn the chicken, then cook for 4 mins more. Check if it’s cooked by poking the tip of a sharp knife into the thickest part; there should be no sign of pink and juices will run clear. STEP 5Bash 1 garlic clove with the flat of a knife and peel off the skin. Crush with a garlic crusher. Mash 2 anchovies with a fork against the side of a small bowl. STEP 6Grate a handful of parmesan cheese and mix with the garlic, anchovies, 5 tbsp Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise and 1 tbsp white wine vinegar. Season to taste. It should be the consistency of yogurt – if yours is thicker, stir in a few tsps water to thin it. STEP 7Shave the cheese with a peeler. Tear 1 large cos or romaine lettuce into large pieces and put in a large bowl. Pull chicken into bite-size strips and scatter half over the leaves, along with half the croutons.

Pour the oil into one extra-large or two large baking trays and put in the oven to heat up. Remove any eyes on the potatoes and give them a good scrub to clean the skins. Cut into 2cm-thick wedges and tip into a saucepan. Cover with cold water, then add the rosemary and 1 tbsp fine sea salt. Cover with a lid and bring to the boil. Boil for 1 min, then remove from the heat and drain. Leave to steam-dry for 5-10 mins. STEP 2Carefully remove the tray or trays from the oven and gently turn the wedges and rosemary in the hot oil. Season, then roast for 50 mins-1 hr, shuffling the wedges around halfway through, until golden and crisp. Meanwhile, heat a dry pan over a medium-high heat and fry the chorizo for 5-6 mins until crispy and the oils have been released. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate. You’ll end up with around 2 tbsp oil in the pan (if it looks like much less, add a drizzle of vegetable oil). STEP 3Tip the flour, garlic and chilli flakes into the pan and stir to create a paste. Cook for a few minutes before adding the milk, a little at a time, whisking well after each addition. Simmer for 3-5 mins until thickened, then remove from the heat.

Air fryer bacon,"6 rashers  streaky bacon, or 3 rashers back bacon","STEP 1Lay the bacon in a single layer in the base of an air fryer – be sure the layers aren't overlapping. The size of the air fryer basket will determine how many rashers you can cook at one time. STEP 2Set the air fryer to 200C and cook streaky bacon rashers for 6-10 mins – just-cooked bacon will take 6 mins, but crispier bacon will take 9-10 mins. Cook back bacon rashers for 4-8 mins, depending on your preference. If you are cooking in batches, remember that the second batch will usually be quicker as the air fryer has heated up.

How to poach an egg,"1 tbsp white wine vinegar, eggs, as many as you want to poach","STEP 1Fill a large saucepan with water and add the vinegar. As soon as the water starts to boil, turn the heat down to a simmer. STEP 2Crack the egg into a small bowl. For a perfect egg with no wispy white bits, crack into a fine strainer and allow the runnier egg white to drain off. STEP 3Stir the water to create a gentle whirlpool which will help the egg white wrap around the yolk. Then carefully slide the egg into the water making sure the heat is low enough not to throw the egg around - there should only be small bubbles rising. STEP 4Cook for 3-4 mins, until the white is cooked through. STEP 5Remove gently using a slotted spoon and blot any water from the base on a tea towel or kitchen paper.

Spinach & ricotta ravioli,"160g '00' flour, plus extra for dusting, 1 whole egg, plus 3 egg yolks (freeze the whites for another recipe), 100g spinach, 150g ricotta, 25g grated parmesan or vegetarian alternative, plus extra to serve, 1 garlic clove, chopped, ½ lemon, zested, grating of  nutmeg, 4 egg yolks, 50g butter, 8 sage leaves","STEP 1For the pasta, put the flour in a large bowl and make a well in the middle. Add the whole egg and yolks and mix with a fork, bringing more flour in from the sides as you mix. When it comes together into a ball, tip out onto a work surface and knead for 10-15 mins until smooth and it bounces back slowly when pressed. Wrap and leave for 20 mins. STEP 2To make the filling, tip the spinach into a colander, pour over boiling water, then leave to cool. When cool enough to handle, squeeze out the water with your hands, then again in a clean tea towel to extract as much moisture as possible. Tip onto a board and finely chop. Tip into a bowl with the ricotta, parmesan, garlic, lemon zest and nutmeg, then season well. Scrape into a piping bag with a 1-2cm-wide nozzle. STEP 3Cut the pasta dough in half and put both pieces through a pasta machine starting on the widest setting, running the dough through twice on each setting until the second-to-last setting. Lightly flour the work surface and lay the sheets of pasta on it horizontally in a way that enables you to easily lift one sheet over the other later. STEP 4Pipe four 7cm wide rings of the filling on the sheet nearest to you, then pipe another four rings directly on top, so you have four 2cm-high ring holders for the egg yolks. Leave approximately 8cm between each. Gently lower an yolk into each ring of filling. Lightly brush the pasta with water around the filling, then lift the second sheet of pasta on top and cup your hand around the filling to gently mould the pasta around it. Try not to leave any air bubbles around the filling. Use a 10cm-round cutter to cut out the ravioli, then carefully lift and pinch the edges together to seal completely. Will keep covered for 30 mins. STEP 5Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and gently lower in the ravioli using a slotted spoon. Boil for 3 mins until the pasta is cooked through, then carefully transfer to two serving bowls. STEP 6Working quickly, heat the butter in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat and fry the sage until crisp, about 1-2 mins. Spoon the butter and sage over the ravioli, scatter with more parmesan, if you like, and serve straightaway.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",1 hr and 15 mins

Put the flour, butter and sugar in a food processor, and blitz until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add 5-6 tbsp cold water, and pulse again until it comes together in a ball. Wrap and chill for 30 mins. STEP 2Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured surface until 3mm thick. Use to line a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin, leaving some overhanging. Chill for 10 mins. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line the pastry case with a sheet of baking parchment, then fill with baking beans. Put the tin on a baking sheet and bake for 15 mins, then remove the beans and parchment and bake for 5-10 mins more until the pastry is dry and lightly golden. Trim the excess using a serrated knife. STEP 3For the filling, blitz the mango chunks to a smooth purée using a hand blender, then add the egg yolks, sugar, melted butter, lime zest and juice, then blitz again until smooth. Stir through the passion fruit pulp to combine. STEP 4Pour the filling into the baked pastry case, then return to the oven for 30-35 mins (still on the baking sheet) until the filling is set with a slight wobble. Check the tart after 25 mins – the curd will set from the outside in, so give the tin a gentle shake to see if it’s still liquid in the middle. If so, continue baking until set. Leave to cool to room temperature, then chill for 2-3 hrs until fully set. STEP 5If you want to decorate the tart, arrange the mango slices around the edge so they’re slightly overlapping, then scatter over the the coconut flakes and mint leaves, and spoon over the passion fruit pulp. Will keep chilled for up to three days.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",30 mins

Beef bourguignon with celeriac mash,"1 tbsp goose fat, 600g shin beef, cut into large chunks, 100g smoked streaky bacon, sliced, 350g shallot  or pearl onions, peeled, 250g chestnut mushrooms (about 20), 2 garlic cloves, sliced, 1 bouquet garni (see know-how below), 1 tbsp tomato purée, 750ml bottle red wine, Burgundy is good, 600g (about 1)  celeriac, 2 tbsp olive oil, plus a glug, 1 or 2  rosemary and thyme sprigs, 2 bay leaves, 4 cardamom pods","STEP 1Heat a large casserole pan and add 1 tbsp goose fat. STEP 2Season 600g large chunks of shin beef and fry until golden brown, about 3-5 mins, then turn over and fry the other side until the meat is browned all over, adding more fat if necessary. Do this in 2-3 batches, transferring the meat to a colander set over a bowl when browned. STEP 3In the same pan, fry 100g sliced smoked streaky bacon, 350g peeled shallots or pearl onions, 250g chestnut mushrooms, 2 sliced garlic cloves and 1 bouquet garni until lightly browned. STEP 4Mix in 1 tbsp tomato purée and cook for a few mins, stirring the mixture. This enriches the bourguignon and makes a great base for the stew. Then return the beef and any drained juices to the pan and stir through. STEP 5Pour over 750ml bottle red wine and about 100ml water so the meat bobs up from the liquid, but isn’t completely covered. Bring to the boil and use a spoon to scrape the caramelised cooking juices from the bottom of the pan – this will give the stew more flavour. STEP 6Heat oven to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2. Make a cartouche: tear off a square of foil slightly larger than the casserole, arrange it in the pan so it covers the top of the stew and trim away any excess foil. Cook for 3 hrs. STEP 7If the sauce looks watery, remove the beef and veg with a slotted spoon, and set aside. Cook the sauce over a high heat for a few mins until the sauce has thickened a little, then return the beef and vegetables to the pan. STEP 8To make the celeriac mash, peel 600g celeriac and cut into cubes. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large frying pan. Tip in the celeriac and fry for 5 mins until it turns golden. Season well with salt and pepper. STEP 9Stir in 1 or 2 sprigs of rosemary and thyme, 2 bay leaves and 4 cardamom pods, then pour over 200ml water, enough to nearly cover the celeriac. Turn the heat to low, partially cover the pan and leave to simmer for 25-30 mins. STEP 10After 25-30 mins, the celeriac should be soft and most of the water will have evaporated. Drain away any remaining water, then remove the herb sprigs, bay and cardamom pods. STEP 11Lightly crush with a potato masher, then finish with a glug of olive oil and season to taste. STEP 12Spoon the beef bourguignon into serving bowls and place a large spoonful of the celeriac mash on top. Garnish with one of the bay leaves, if you like.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",20 mins

Use a large knife to hasselback the potatoes; cut incisions in each potato making sure you don’t cut through to the base, and keep the cuts as close together as possible. Toss the potatoes in oil and some seasoning in your largest roasting tin (an oven tray is ideal – line with parchment first if it’s old). Roast for 20 mins. STEP 2Butterfly the prawns by cutting a line down the back of each one, through the shell from the base of the head to the top of the tail. Pull out the black line of intestine from each one. Clean the mussels under cold water, pulling off any hairy or stringy bits. Hasselback the squid in the same way you did the potatoes.

Rhubarb gin,"1kg pink rhubarb stalks, 400g caster sugar (don't use golden - it muddies the colour), 800ml gin","STEP 1Wash the rhubarb, trim the stalks and discard the base and any leaves. Cut the stalks into 3cm lengths. Put in a large jar with the sugar. Shake everything around, put the lid on and leave overnight. The sugar will draw the juice out of the rhubarb. STEP 2After 24 hrs, add the gin, seal and shake everything around. Leave for about 4 weeks before drinking. You can strain the liquor off through a muslin-lined sieve and transfer to a bottle, but I often just leave the rhubarb and booze in the jar and ladle it into drinks that way. Over time the rhubarb and the gin go a much paler colour – this doesn’t look as dramatic.

Rack of lamb with warm salad of mixed beans & slow-roast tomatoes,"2 tbsp olive oil, 3 ripe plum tomatoes, trimmed and halved, few thyme sprigs, 3 garlic cloves, left whole, 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar, handful basil leaves, 1 x 8-bone rack of lamb, well trimmed (see tip, below), 1 tbsp olive oil, 25g butter, 4 garlic cloves, smashed but with skin on, few thyme sprigs, 200g podded broad beans, 200g fine beans, trimmed, 85g mangetout, 1 tbsp olive oil, 2 shallots, finely sliced into rings, small handful toasted flaked almonds, 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar","STEP 1Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. For the tomatoes heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan (if you don't have an ovenproof pan, use a standard frying pan then transfer to a roasting tray before putting in the oven) and fry cut-side down. Add the thyme and garlic and cook for 3 mins until coloured. Turn over the tomatoes, drizzle with vinegar, then roast in the oven for 20 mins until soft and caramelised. Leave to rest. STEP 2While the tomatoes are roasting, cook the lamb. Season the meat generously and heat the oil and butter in another ovenproof frying pan. Place the lamb, fat-side down, in the pan and scatter round the garlic and thyme. Brown the lamb really well, then turn over. STEP 3Baste the lamb with the pan juices, then transfer to the oven for 10 mins for lamb that is pink. If you prefer it more well done, give it 5 mins more. Leave the lamb somewhere warm to rest. STEP 4While the lamb is cooking, prepare the bean salad. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the broad beans for a few mins. Scoop them out with a slotted spoon straight into a bowl of ice water, then slip them from their skins into a bowl. Boil the fine beans for 2 mins, then add the mangetout and cook both for 1 min longer. Drain, plunge into iced water (this keeps their bright green colour), leave for 1 min to cool down, then drain again. STEP 5Heat the oil in a frying pan, quickly cook the shallots for 1 min until starting to soften and colour, then add the fine beans and mangetout. Cook for about 1 min to heat through, then toss in the almonds and finally toss through the broad beans. STEP 6Scatter the basil over the tomatoes, saving a few of the very small leaves for garnishing. Make the dressing by simply whisking the oil and vinegar together. Carve the lamb into cutlets on a board with a very sharp knife (see tip, below). You are now ready to plate up. STEP 7Place the salad to one side of each plate. Line up three tomato halves down the other side of the plate. Lay three chops on top of the salad, slightly overlapping, with the bones pointing in the same direction. Drizzle the dressing around the plate and scatter the small basil leaves over the tomatoes.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",40 mins
"Pan-fried sea trout, peas & chorizo fricassée","2 fillets of  sea trout about 150g each (or use salmon), 25g butter, 1 lemon, halved, 1 tbsp olive oil, 100g cured chorizo, about 1 small sausage, diced, 350g waxy potatoes, such as Charlotte, peeled and cut into small cubes, large pinch sweet smoked paprika, 125ml fresh chicken stock, 150g cooked peas, 3 tbsp olive oil, 2 tbsp small capers, drained, 1 red onion, finely chopped, 1 tbsp red wine vinegar, small bunch tarragon, chopped","STEP 1First make the dressing. Heat 1 tbsp of the olive oil in a small saucepan. Add the capers and the onion and cook for 3 mins until softened. Splash in the red wine vinegar and bubble down, then remove the pan from the heat. Add the rest of the oil and the tarragon, then leave to infuse. STEP 2For the fricassée, heat the oil in a sauté pan, add the chorizo and fry for 2 mins until it starts to crisp and render out red oil. Throw the potatoes and paprika in the pan and cook for 5 mins, tossing occasionally, until they start to brown on the edges. STEP 3Pour in the chicken stock, turn up the heat and boil the stock for 8-10 mins until it has nearly all evaporated and the potatoes are tender. Stir the peas into the potatoes and cook for 2 mins more until heated through, then set aside. STEP 4Using a sharp knife, score the skin of the trout fillet at close intervals, then season generously with sea salt and black pepper. STEP 5Heat the butter in a non-stick frying pan. When it starts to sizzle, carefully lay the fish in the pan, skin-side down. Gently fry for about 8 mins until the skin is crisp and golden and most of the flesh has changed colour with just the top still raw. STEP 6Carefully turn the fish fillets over, then squeeze over the juice from one half of the lemon. Cook for 1 min more, basting fish with the lemony pan juices. Turn off the heat and leave the fish in the pan. You are now ready to plate up – you can serve the other lemon half on the side if you like. STEP 7Spoon a pile of the fricassée into the centre of each plate. Place another spoonful of the mixture on top to create a small heap. Gently sit the fish fillet on top, skin-side up. Spoon the caper dressing around the outside of the plate and serve.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",30 mins
Frozen banana & praline parfait,"200g caster sugar, 100g whole blanched hazelnuts, sunflower oil, for greasing, 2 ripe bananas (the skin should be very spotty, but not bruised or black), 2 tsp lemon juice, 300ml double cream, 2 egg whites, 100g caster sugar, 4 ripe but firm bananas, 100g caster sugar","STEP 1To make the praline, put the sugar into a heavy-based pan with 3 tbsp water. Place over a low heat until the sugar has dissolved and is clear. Don't stir, or it will crystallise. Increase the heat and bubble to a dark caramel (see video technique), about 5 mins. Remove from the heat, stir through the nuts, then tip onto a lightly greased non-stick baking tray. Spread to level and leave to cool. Be careful as the tray will get very hot. STEP 2When the praline is cold and brittle, break it into pieces. Then, using the end of a rolling pin, smash it up until fairly well crushed. If this is proving hard work, tip into a food processor and pulse until it’s the texture of coarse breadcrumbs. STEP 3Line a 1.2-litre loaf tin with a strip of baking parchment (this size tin gives a neat shape, but you can set the parfait in any shaped tin, or individual pudding basins or ramekins). In a bowl, mash the bananas with half the lemon juice until you have a rough purée, then set aside. STEP 4Put the cream into a bowl and whip until it holds its shape but is still a little soft. In another very clean bowl and using a very clean electric whisk, beat the egg whites with a squeeze more lemon juice until stiff. Slowly add the sugar until you have a stiff, shiny meringue. STEP 5Gently fold the whipped cream and meringue together, then add the banana and most of the praline, leaving about 4 tbsp to serve. Spoon into the loaf tin, smooth the top and freeze until firm, preferably overnight. STEP 6To serve, remove the parfait from the freezer 10 mins before serving and leave in the fridge to soften slightly. Meanwhile, slice the bananas on a slant, allowing 3 slices for each serving. Lay the slices on a baking tray set on a wooden board and scatter heavily with the sugar. Use a blowtorch to caramelise the banana, then set aside. Be very careful as the tray will be extremely hot. If you don't have a blowtorch, place the slices into a hot, dry frying pan and sear the sugar-coated sides until caramelised. Lift and flip them over to a tray. STEP 7To plate up, sprinkle a neat line of praline just off-centre on each plate. Arrange the slices of caramelised banana at opposing angles. Unmould the parfait, then use a warmed knife to neaten the sides and cut into finger-thick slices. Lay the slice on the opposite side of the plate to the banana and serve straight away.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",40 mins

Trim and slice the salmon into 6 equal-size square chunks. If the scallops are large, cut them in half lengthways. Peel and devein the prawns if needed. STEP 2Place the strained oyster juice and fish stock into a shallow saucepan and bring to a simmer. First add the salmon and poach for 1 min. Add the prawns and oysters (if using large ones) and poach for 1 min more. Add the scallops and poach for 1 min more, then add the oysters (if small) and simmer everything for a final min until just cooked. STEP 3Carefully tip the fish and poaching liquid into a sieve over a large saucepan or bowl, keeping all the salmon chunks intact. STEP 4Heat half the butter in the cleaned shallow pan and add the shallot. Cook very gently for 5 mins until soft but not coloured, then pour in the alcohol and boil until reduced to a few tablespoons. Pour in the poaching liquid and boil down until reduced by half, about 20-25 mins. Stir in the cream and, once more, reduce by half. Turn down to a gentle simmer and whisk in the rest of the butter. STEP 5Gently add the seafood to the sauce, taking care not to break up the salmon. Simmer lightly until heated through, then add most of the herbs, squeeze over the lemon juice and set aside. STEP 6Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling water until just done, about 3-4 mins, then drain well and add back to the pan with a drizzle of olive oil and the rest of the herbs. You are now ready to plate up. STEP 7Use a roasting fork to twirl a neat bundle of spaghetti. Stand the bundle in the middle of a warm large pasta bowl.

STEP 2Season 600g large chunks of shin beef and fry until golden brown, about 3-5 mins, then turn over and fry the other side until the meat is browned all over, adding more fat if necessary. Do this in 2-3 batches, transferring the meat to a colander set over a bowl when browned. STEP 3In the same pan, fry 100g sliced smoked streaky bacon, 350g peeled shallots or pearl onions, 250g chestnut mushrooms, 2 sliced garlic cloves and 1 bouquet garni until lightly browned. STEP 4Mix in 1 tbsp tomato purée and cook for a few mins, stirring the mixture. This enriches the bourguignon and makes a great base for the stew. Then return the beef and any drained juices to the pan and stir through. STEP 5Pour over 750ml bottle red wine and about 100ml water so the meat bobs up from the liquid, but isn’t completely covered. Bring to the boil and use a spoon to scrape the caramelised cooking juices from the bottom of the pan – this will give the stew more flavour. STEP 6Heat oven to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2. Make a cartouche: tear off a square of foil slightly larger than the casserole, arrange it in the pan so it covers the top of the stew and trim away any excess foil. Cook for 3 hrs. STEP 7If the sauce looks watery, remove the beef and veg with a slotted spoon, and set aside. Cook the sauce over a high heat for a few mins until the sauce has thickened a little, then return the beef and vegetables to the pan. STEP 8To make the celeriac mash, peel 600g celeriac and cut into cubes. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large frying pan. Tip in the celeriac and fry for 5 mins until it turns golden. Season well with salt and pepper. STEP 9Stir in 1 or 2 sprigs of rosemary and thyme, 2 bay leaves and 4 cardamom pods, then pour over 200ml water, enough to nearly cover the celeriac. Turn the heat to low, partially cover the pan and leave to simmer for 25-30 mins. STEP 10After 25-30 mins, the celeriac should be soft and most of the water will have evaporated. Drain away any remaining water, then remove the herb sprigs, bay and cardamom pods. STEP 11Lightly crush with a potato masher, then finish with a glug of olive oil and season to taste. STEP 12Spoon the beef bourguignon into serving bowls and place a large spoonful of the celeriac mash on top. Garnish with one of the bay leaves, if you like.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",20 mins
Chocolate marquise,"300g dark chocolate, use 70%, good quality, such as Valrhona or Green & Black's, 150g unsalted butter, softened, 150g caster sugar, 6 tbsp cocoa powder, 6 eggs, 450ml double cream, 300g box After Eights","STEP 1Break the chocolate into pieces and place in a heatproof bowl. Then assemble a bain-marie – do this by pouring a little water into a saucepan and placing the bowl over the water (making sure the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl). Set the pan over a gentle heat and warm the water until the chocolate has melted. Take off the heat and leave to cool a little. STEP 2Meanwhile, place the butter and half the sugar into another large bowl. Using a tabletop mixer or electric hand whisk, beat until the mixture is really light and creamy, then beat in the cocoa powder. STEP 3Separate the eggs (the whites can be frozen for another time) and put the yolks in a third bowl. Tip in the remaining sugar, then beat together until pale and creamy. To check if it’s ready, make a figure-of-eight shape in the mixture with the beater – it should hold its shape for a moment. In a fourth bowl, whip the cream until thickened with soft peaks. STEP 4Pour the melted chocolate into the butter mixture, and carefully stir through until it is well combined. Gently fold in the egg mixture. When this is amalgamated, stir in the whipped cream. Now line a 6.5 x 22cm tin with 3 layers of cling film, leaving a 10cm overhang. STEP 5Spoon the mixture into a large piping bag with a large nozzle attached (see Gordon’s steps, far right). Pipe a layer over the bottom of the tin, then cover this with a layer of After Eights (cut some in half to ensure they fit). Pipe over another layer of chocolate cream, followed by a layer of After Eights. Continue until you have 4 layers of chocolate mints and the tin is full, finishing with a chocolate cream layer. Fold over the cling film, then chill overnight or up to 2 days. STEP 6Just before serving, place the marquise in the freezer for 10 mins to make it easier to slice. Place the tin, bottomside up, on a serving plate, slide off the tin, then peel away the cling film. If you have a blowtorch, quickly run the flame over the surface of the marquise to give it a glossy sheen. Alternatively, dip a palette knife in boiling water and smooth the surface that way. Use a serrated knife dipped in boiling water to cut the marquise into slices.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",30 mins
Beef wellington,"a good beef fillet (preferably Aberdeen Angus) of around 1kg/2lb 4oz, 3 tbsp olive oil, 250g/9oz chestnut mushroom, include some wild ones if you like, 50g/2oz butter, 1 large sprig fresh thyme, 100ml/3.5 fl oz dry white wine, 12 slices prosciutto, 500g/1lb 2oz pack puff pastry, thawed if frozen, a little flour, for dusting, 2 egg yolks beaten with 1 tsp water","STEP 1Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. STEP 2Sit the 1kg beef fillet on a roasting tray, brush with 1 tbsp olive oil and season with pepper, then roast for 15 mins for medium-rare or 20 mins for medium. When the beef is cooked to your liking, remove from the oven to cool, then chill in the fridge for about 20 mins. STEP 3While the beef is cooling, chop 250g chestnut (and wild, if you like) mushrooms as finely as possible so they have the texture of coarse breadcrumbs. You can use a food processor to do this, but make sure you pulse-chop the mushrooms so they don’t become a slurry. STEP 4Heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil and 50g butter in a large pan and fry the mushrooms on a medium heat, with 1 large sprig fresh thyme, for about 10 mins stirring often, until you have a softened mixture. STEP 5Season the mushroom mixture, pour over 100ml dry white wine and cook for about 10 mins until all the wine has been absorbed. The mixture should hold its shape when stirred. STEP 6Remove the mushroom duxelle from the pan to cool and discard the thyme. STEP 7Overlap two pieces of cling film over a large chopping board. Lay 12 slices prosciutto on the cling film, slightly overlapping, in a double row. STEP 8Spread half the duxelles over the prosciutto, then sit the fillet on it and spread the remaining duxelles over. STEP 9Use the cling film’s edges to draw the prosciutto around the fillet, then roll it into a sausage shape, twisting the ends of cling film to tighten it as you go. STEP 10Chill the fillet while you roll out the pastry. STEP 11Dust your work surface with a little flour. Roll out a third of the 500g pack of puff pastry to a 18 x 30cm strip and place on a non-stick baking sheet. STEP 12Roll out the remainder of the 500g pack of puff pastry to about 28 x 36cm. STEP 13Unravel the fillet from the cling film and sit it in the centre of the smaller strip of pastry. STEP 14Beat the 2 egg yolks with 1 tsp water and brush the pastry’s edges, and the top and sides of the wrapped fillet. STEP 15Using a rolling pin, carefully lift and drape the larger piece of pastry over the fillet, pressing well into the sides. STEP 16Trim the joins to about a 4cm rim. Seal the rim with the edge of a fork or spoon handle. STEP 17Glaze all over with more egg yolk and, using the back of a knife, mark the beef Wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry. STEP 18Chill for at least 30 mins and up to 24 hrs. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. STEP 19Brush the Wellington with a little more egg yolk and cook until golden and crisp – 20-25 mins for medium-rare beef, 30 mins for medium. Allow to stand for 10 mins before serving in thick slices.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",2 hrs and 30 mins
Lemon tart with summer berries,"5 unwaxed lemons, 6 eggs, 250g golden caster sugar, 200ml double cream, icing sugar, for dusting and decorating, 375g block dessert pastry, 4 tbsp icing sugar, 300g strawberry, hulled, halved or quartered, 350g raspberry, 150g blueberry, 1 tsp sherry vinegar, handful mint, leaves, finely shredded","STEP 1Finely grate the zest of 3 of the lemons into a bowl. Halve all the lemons, then use a fork to squeeze out all the juice and pulp into the bowl with the zest – don’t worry about the seeds. Crack the eggs into a separate bowl, then whisk in the caster sugar until completely combined. Whisk in the cream and lemon juice mix, then set aside. STEP 2Place a 23cm tart ring or loose-bottom flan tin on a baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper. On a surface dusted with icing sugar, roll out the pastry to the thickness of a £1 coin. Lift onto a rolling pin, then drape over the tart ring or flan tin, leaving the excess hanging over the edge. Carefully press the pastry into the sides with a small ball of pastry. Put in fridge or freezer for 20 mins to allow pastry to chill. STEP 3While the pastry is chilling, heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Prick the base of the pastry case, line with greaseproof paper and baking beans, then bake for 15 mins. Remove the paper and beans, then bake the case for 5-10 mins more until it is biscuity brown and crisp. Lower oven to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2. STEP 4Use a ladle to push the lemon custard through a sieve into a bowl, pressing down on the pulp to extract as much juice as possible. Skim the bubbles from the surface of the custard, then pour the custard into a jug. Pull the tart out of the oven slightly, then pour in the custard so it comes to the top. You may have some left over. Push tart back in, then bake for 35-40 mins until the top forms a light crust and the custard is just set. Leave to cool, then chill. STEP 5While the tart is cooling, make the berry salad. Place a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and scatter the icing sugar over the base. Heat until the sugar dissolves and caramelises. Throw in the berries, toss with the sugar, then splash in the sherry vinegar. Bubble for a min until everything is just starting to soften, then tip onto a plate and leave to cool slightly. STEP 6Use a serrated knife to trim away the pastry and make a neat edge. Dust the tart lightly with icing sugar, then use a blowtorch to caramelise the top. Leave the top to set, then repeat the process so that you get an extra-thick layer of caramel. Stir the mint through the berries. Serve the tart in slices with a bowl of the berry salad on the side.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",30 mins
Mediterranean salmon fillet,"1 whole salmon fillet, about 800g, skin-on and well trimmed  (organic farmed salmon is best), 9 marinated sundried tomatoes, halved, 18 black olives, preferably Niçoise, pitted, 18 basil leaves, 3 tbsp olive oil","STEP 1Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Lay the salmon on a board and, using an apple corer, make 18 holes in rows of hree in the salmon fillet, just going down to the skin, but not cutting all the way through. STEP 2Take a piece of sun-dried tomato and an olive and, using a basil leaf as a wrapper, roll up into a tight little parcel. Each parcel should be just big enough to plug into one of the holes. STEP 3As you roll each parcel, stuff them into the holes until they are all filled. STEP 4Place the salmon fillet on a piece of greased foil on a baking tray, then season with salt and pepper and drizzle with the olive oil. Roast in the oven for 20 mins until just cooked. Remove from the oven and leave to cool until just warm, then carefully lift the salmon onto a serving dish and serve, or leave to cool completely (see Gordon’s tips, below).","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",20 mins
Strawberry & white chocolate millefeuille,"plain flour for dusting, 3 tbsp caster sugar, plus extra for serving, 350g puff pastry, 300ml double cream, 1 vanilla pod, 600g strawberries, small bunch of basil, leaves picked, with a few of the smaller leaves left whole for the salad, zest ½ lemon, 50g good-quality white chocolate","STEP 1Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. On a lightly floured surface scattered with a little sugar, roll out the pastry to a rectangle slightly larger than 28 x 30cm. Line a large baking sheet with baking parchment and scatter with more sugar. Use the rolling pin to lift the pastry onto the baking parchment. STEP 2Scatter more caster sugar over the pastry and cover with another sheet of baking parchment. Lay another heavy baking sheet (or a baking sheet weighed down with an empty ceramic oven dish if yours aren't heavy) on top and bake for 25-30 mins until the pastry is golden and crisp, then set aside to cool. STEP 3To make the filling, tip the cream into a bowl with 3 tbsp of sugar, and the vanilla seeds. Lightly whisk until the cream just hold its shape and set aside. Hull and quarter the strawberries and set a few aside for the salad, then cut the rest into 3 or 4 chunks. Finely shred the basil, then fold through the cream with the chopped strawberries and lemon zest, then chill until needed. STEP 4When the pastry has cooled completely trim the edges to form a neat 28 x 30cm rectangle. Cut into 3 equal rectangles – to get them precisely the same size, cut one then lay it on the rest of the pastry and use it as a guide to the next rectangle, then repeat. STEP 5To assemble the millefeuille, lay down one rectangle of pastry, add half of the cream and strawberry mix and flatten with the back of a spoon. Place the second pastry layer on top and gently press down. Finely grate over half the white chocolate and top with the remaining cream mix. Place the final layer of pastry on and press down gently so that the filling just starts to bulge over the edges. STEP 6Use a palette knife to smooth the filling along the sides so that it is level with the edges of pastry and fills any gaps. Add a smear of filling across cut pastry edges to help the grated chocolate to stick. Grate chocolate on top. The easiest way to get grated chocolate to stick to the sides is to help it on with a palette knife. Mix the reserved strawberries and the small basil leaves to make a simple salad. STEP 7To serve, carefully slice the millefeuille into 6 equal pieces. As you slice, hold the millefeuille together by placing a finger at either side of the blade. Place a piece of millefeuille to the side of each plate. Spoon a small pile of strawberry salad on the opposite side of the plate and serve.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",30 mins

Rub in the butter until it is the texture of crumbs, then mix in the sugar and thyme leaves. Make a well in the centre. Beat the egg yolks together, then stir into the mixture with a table knife until it forms soft clumps. Using your fingers, draw the pastry together into a rough dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead into a smooth ball. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 30 mins. Rub a little softened butter around a plain 20cm x 2cm flan ring. STEP 2Cover a heavy baking sheet with nonstick baking parchment and place the ring in the centre. Dust the work surface and rolling pin with flour. Lightly re-knead the dough until smooth, then roll out to a round roughly 30cm in diameter. Lift the dough over the rolling pin and drape over the ring. Press gently into the sides and let the overhang fall on the outside. Break off a chunk of pastry and roll into a ball. Dip into a little of the icing sugar, then use it to press the dough into the ring. Do not trim at this stage. Chill the tart case for at least 30 mins, preferably in the freezer. STEP 3Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Cover the tart case with a large round of baking parchment, then half-fill with uncooked rice. Place in the centre of the oven and bake for 15 mins.

Mix in the beaten egg and 1 tbsp ice-cold water, then draw together to a moist pastry, kneading lightly. Wrap with cling film and chill for at least 20 mins. STEP 2Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Brush a deep, loose-bottom, 24cm tart tin with oil, then season it. Set a small ball of pastry aside and roll out the rest on a lightly floured surface to a large round, 38-40cm. Lift the pastry into the tin using the rolling pin and press into the sides. Press any cracks together and let the excess overhang. STEP 3Use a small ball of pastry to press the tart case into the flutes. Save a little more pastry for later (see Step 3 in the Step by step images). Prick the base lightly with a fork and chill the tart case, preferably in the freezer, for at least 30 mins. Cut out a circle of baking paper larger than the tart, scrunch it up, unravel and press into the case. STEP 4Fill the case with baking beans, stand on a baking sheet and bake for 20 mins. Remove the paper and beans and brush with the remaining yolk. Return to the oven for 5 mins, brush again and return for a final 10-15 mins until glazed and golden. Remove from the oven. Turn the oven to 140C/fan 120C/gas 1. STEP 5To make the custard, beat together the whole eggs, yolks, crème fraîche, milk and tarragon and season to taste. STEP 6For the filling, sauté the bacon in 1 tbsp oil until browned and beginning to crisp, about 5 mins. Add 2 tbsp oil to the pan and sauté the onion and chicory with the bacon, stirring until lightly cooked, about 5 mins. Strain any juices through a sieve, then tip into a big bowl. STEP 7Heat 2 more tbsp oil and stir-fry the mushrooms over a high heat for 3-5 mins. Strain and mix into the bowl. Wilt the rocket in same pan over a high heat and leave to cool. STEP 8Mix the cheeses and rocket into the custard and whizz with a hand blender until well mixed, then stir in the rest of the filling ingredients. STEP 9Put the tart case back into the oven. Leaving the shelf slightly out, ladle as much filling into the case as you can. Try to ladle the solid filling in first, then top up with custard. Push the shelf in and bake for 50 mins-1 hour until the quiche is set in the middle, turning for even baking. STEP 10Remove and trim the pastry edge so that it’s in line with the top of the tin. This is easiest with a small, serrated knife. Cool the tart for at least 1 hour before removing from the tin and serving in slices.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",1 hr
Gordon's mix & match steak,"1 steak, oil, 1whole garlic clove, herb  sprig, butter, for fillet or rib-eye steaks","STEP 1Choosing your steak Rib-eye: The chef’s favourite. Allow 200-250g per head to allow for trimming. This cut used to be quite cheap, but is now creeping up in price. It has an open-fibre texture and a marbling of creamy fat. Cook with the surrounding fat still attached, then remove after cooking, if you prefer. The fat adds flavour as well as basting the meat during cooking.  Fillet: The most expensive cut. Allow 100-125g per head. It is very lean and, because it has short fibres, very tender. Ask for a piece cut from the middle of the fillet, not the end. Also, ensure that the butcher removes the sinewy chain that runs down the side. I like to cook my steaks split in half lengthways, not the usual round medallion shape.  T-bone: Generally 350-400g each, including bone. It has a good marbling of fat with a layer of creamy fat on one side – this should be left on for cooking, then removed if you like. You get about 200-250g of meat, with a sirloin on one side of the bone and a fillet on the other. You also get some marrow in the bone which can be spread on the cooked meat. STEP 2To cook your steaks, heat a frying pan – to a moderate heat for fillet, hot for T-bone or very hot for rib-eye. Add a swirl of oil, with a whole garlic clove and a herb sprig. Season the steaks with salt and pepper and cook for 1½-2½ mins on each side. For fillet steak, cook the rounded edges too, turning to seal them well. STEP 3If you’re cooking fillet or rib-eye steaks, add a knob of butter to the pan, allow to foam a little and baste the steaks. T-bone steak has plenty of fat, so simply spoon it over the meat as it renders down. Remove steaks to a plate and allow to rest for at least 5 mins. Trim off any unwanted fat. STEP 4Slice fillet or rib-eye steak along the grain, then arrange on a plate with your chosen sauce and side dish. My personal preferences are for rib-eye with mushrooms and the shallot & red wine sauce; fillet steak with oven chips and bois boudrin; and T-bone with wilted spinach and mushroom sauce.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",15 mins
Summer berry meringues,"3 egg whites, ½ tsp lemon juice, 150g caster sugar, 200ml tub crème fraîche, 200ml natural yogurt, 300g strawberry, hulled, 250g raspberry, small bunch mint, leaves stripped and finely chopped, small knob  fresh   root ginger, peeled and finely grated, 5 tbsp icing sugar  (you may not need it all), 9 little sprigs of mint  and icing sugar, to decorate","STEP 1Heat oven to 110C/fan 90C/gas ¼. Tip the egg whites and lemon juice into the clean bowl of a food mixer. Whisk until the whites double in volume and hold a peak when the whisk is drawn through them. Keep the whisk running and add the sugar a tbsp at a time, incorporating completely before adding the next. Whisk until all the sugar has been added and the whites are glossy. STEP 2Place a square of baking parchment on a large baking sheet. Pencil nine circles, about 7cm each, onto the parchment. Spoon the meringue into a large piping bag fitted with a plain nozzle and pipe concentric rounds to fit each drawn circle, piping two or more rings around the edge to form a nest. Bake for 2 hrs until they are crisp and lift off the paper easily. Leave to cool completely. STEP 3Whisk the crème fraîche until stiff, then fold in the yogurt. Set 2 strawberries and 9 raspberries aside and roughly chop the rest. Tip the chopped berries, mint and ginger into a bowl. Sprinkle with a little icing sugar and use a wooden spoon to mash to a rough purée. Gently fold the berries into the yogurt mix, adding icing sugar to taste. STEP 4To assemble, cut the remaining strawberries into 9 slices and place a slice inside each meringue case.

Pear tarte tatin,"8 pears, 100g caster sugar, 100g butter, 2 star anise, 3 cardamom pods, 1 large cinnamon stick, 2 tbsp brandy, 500g block all-butter puff pastry","STEP 1Core the pears, then peel as neatly as possible and halve. If you like, they can be prepared up to a day ahead and kept in the fridge, uncovered, so that they dry out. STEP 2Tip the sugar, butter, star anise, cardamom and cinnamon into an ovenproof frying pan, about 20cm wide, and place over a high heat until bubbling. Shake the pan and stir the buttery sauce until it separates and the sugar caramelises to a toffee colour. STEP 3Lay the pears in the pan, then cook in the sauce for 10-12 mins, tossing occasionally, until completely caramelised. Don’t worry about them burning – they won’t – but you want to caramelise them as much as possible. Splash in the brandy and let it flambé, then set the pears aside. STEP 4Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Roll the pastry out to the thickness of a £1 coin. Using a plate slightly larger than the top of the pan, cut out a circle, then press the edges of the circle of pastry to thin them out. STEP 5When the pears have cooled slightly, arrange them in the pan, cut side up, in a floral shape, with the pears around the edge pointing inwards. Rest the cinnamon stick on the top in the centre, with the cardamom pods scattered around. STEP 6Drape the pastry over the pears, then tuck the edges down the pan sides and under the fruit (see Gordon’s guide). Pierce the pastry a few times, then bake for 15 mins. If a lot of juice bubbles up the side of the pan, pour it off at this stage (see guide). Reduce oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4 and bake for 15 mins more until the pastry is golden. Leave the tart to stand for 10 mins, then invert it carefully onto a serving dish.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",10 mins
Pork & ham pie,"6 eggs, 400g minced pork, 200g good-quality pork sausagemeat, 140g cooked   ham  meat (see know-how), chopped into small chunks, small handful sage  leaves, 1 small onion, finely chopped, few shakes Tabasco sauce, 2 leaves gelatine  (optional, see Know-how), 100g lard, plus extra for greasing, 450g plain flour, plus extra for dusting, 4 tbsp milk, 1 egg, beaten","STEP 1Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, then boil the eggs for exactly 7½ mins. Cool in cold water, peel and set aside. Tip the pork, sausagemeat, ham, sage and onion into a large bowl. Season generously and add a few shakes of Tabasco. Mix well with your hands until completely combined. Take about 1 tbsp of the mix, shape into a small burger and fry in a pan. Taste for seasoning. Slightly over-seasoned is perfect. STEP 2Melt a few tbsps lard, brush a 1-litre terrine dish with an even layer of the melted fat, then dust with flour. To make the pastry, tip the flour into a bowl with 2 tsp salt. Put the lard and milk into a pan with 150ml water, then heat until the lard has completely melted. Pour into the flour and beat with a wooden spoon until combined. Tip onto the surface and knead until it all comes together. STEP 3Cut a piece of baking parchment to fit the bottom and long sides of the terrine dish with some hanging over the edge. Take about two-thirds of the pastry dough and shape it into a rectangle roughly the width and length of the dish. Lay the dough into the terrine and, using your fingers, press it into the bottom, the corners and up the sides of the dish until it comes to the top and hangs over the rim a little. STEP 4Take half the meat mixture and pat it into a shape that will fit the terrine dish, then lay it in. Use your fingers to make a trench down the middle of the meat. Trim the tops and bottoms off the eggs, lay them, in a row, along the trench, then season. Trimming the eggs like this ensures that each slice of pie will contain both egg white and yolk. STEP 5Take the rest of the meat mixture, pat it out to a rectangle that will fit over the eggs, and press it over the top. Brush the overhang of the pastry with the beaten egg, then roll out the rest of the pastry to fit over the pie. STEP 6Pinch edges together to fix the top. Brush top generously with egg and pierce three holes along the top. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Place pie on a baking sheet and bake for 30 mins. Lower the heat to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4, then continue to cook for another hour. Leave to cool. Carefully turn dish upside-down onto a board and use the sides of the paper to pull the pie out of the dish. If sides aren’t brown enough, return it to the oven on a baking tray at 200C/fan 180C/gas 6 until coloured. Cool, then chill in the fridge. STEP 7If you want to fill the pie with jelly, soak the gelatine in cold water and warm the stock until hot, but not simmering. Remove the gelatine from the water and squeeze to remove excess liquid, then stir into the stock to dissolve. Leave to cool to room temperature, then transfer to a squeezy bottle. Pour the jelly into one of the holes until it comes to the top. Place the pie on a dish in the fridge until the jelly has set, then repeat twice more, so the jelly has filled each hole. Leave to set in the fridge overnight.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",1 hr and 15 mins

Ultimate spaghetti carbonara recipe,"100g pancetta, 50g pecorino cheese, 50g parmesan, 3 large eggs, 350g spaghetti, 2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole, 50g unsalted butter, sea salt and freshly ground black pepper","STEP 1Put a large saucepan of water on to boil. STEP 2Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together. STEP 3Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside. STEP 4Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked). STEP 5Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it. STEP 6While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic. STEP 7Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard. STEP 8Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet. STEP 9Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later. STEP 10Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated. STEP 11Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed. STEP 12Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",15 mins

Classic California roll,"50g fresh, sushi-grade salmon fillet, 1cm thick, skinned and boned (ask your fishmonger to do this for you), 1 sheet of  nori, 1 handful  cooked sushi rice, roughly 80g, 1 tbsp tobiko  (flying fish roe) or masago (capelin roe), alternatively black or white sesame seeds, wasabi (optional), ½ avocado, stoned and skin removed, sliced into 1cm pieces, 40g white crabmeat","STEP 1Slice the salmon lengthways into 1cm-wide strips. Put a sheet of cling film underneath a sushi mat then put a sheet of nori onto the sushi mat, with the lines of the sheet lying horizontally across the mat. It does not matter if the shiny side is facing up or down – the nori won’t be seen in the finished roll. STEP 2Wet your fingers slightly (damp fingers help when handling sticky sushi rice). Leave a space about 3-4cm from the bottom of the nori sheet. Spread the rice over the rest of the nori evenly and gently with your fingertips. You want roughly a 2mm layer. Do not press it onto the sheet. STEP 3Sprinkle 1 tbsp of tobiko, masago or sesame seeds over the rice; this will end up on the outside of the roll. Carefully flip the nori over on the mat so the rice is now underneath and the nori is face-up. Put the wasabi, if using, and salmon in a single line at the bottom of the nori on the area without the rice, then add half the avocado strips alongside, followed by the crabmeat in a line next to the avocado. It should all fit on to the clear area of nori just below the rice. STEP 4Holding the filling in place with your index fingers, start rolling the mat from the bottom edge of the nori towards the top of the rice edge. Keep rolling, holding the roll in place, 3 or 4 times, making sure that it's tightly rolling so that there are no gaps between the fillings and the nori. STEP 5Put the sushi roll on a clean, dry chopping board. Gently cut each roll into 8 pieces with a sharp, wet knife, smoothly and quickly. It’s useful to keep fingers damp when handling and chopping. We recommend cleaning the knife after every cut to avoid the rice sticking.","https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2024/03/cropped-padded-GF-footer-logo-988784d-e9bbf17.png?quality=90&resize=120,27",30 mins
